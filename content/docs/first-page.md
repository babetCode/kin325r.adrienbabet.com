Chapter 1 HW

**Learning Objectives:** Upon completion of the following topic (from in class lectures and completion of the external brain assignments), you will be able to:
1. Describe and provide examples of how biomechanics may be studies at many levels,
ranging from single cell to full organism.
2. Analyze how a solid understanding of biomechanics may be relevant to your current
studies in kinesiology future career goals.
3. Define the basic sub-disciplines of mechanics and explain how they relate to each other.

**Assignments:**
1. Use words or images to provide an example of something which a biomechanist might study at each of the following levels. Remember, biomechanics typically involved the **study of movement or forces causing the movement**:
    - Whole organism level
    - System level
    - Organ level
    - Tissue level
    - Cell level
    - Cellular subunits level

**Whole Organism:** Gait analysis of the whole organism

**System level:** Muscular system and the movement it produces

**Organ level:** Individual muscle, or perhaps heart or lungs if combinging biomechanics with physiology

**Tissue level:** Tendon, ligament, or bone tissue

**Cell level:** Myocytes

**Cellular subunits level:** Cell wall stress, heel strike hemolysis

2. Using either Pubmed or Google Scholar, find an article showing an example of
biomechanics being applied for either 1) improving health or 2) improving sport
performance. Include the abstract from the article, complete APA formatted citation, and a short explanation for how you think this article represents biomechanics being applied to this specific area.

**Abstract:**
> The present study was conducted to biomechanics data on snowboard riding in order to help the improvement of the performance of the members of the national snowboarding team. Based on the results of this study, the following conclusions can be drawn. In neutral positions, the ‘up’motions were taken in which the heights of the right and left hips were relatively the highest and at the moments of turns in both directions, ‘down’motions were taken in which the heights of the right and left hips were relatively the lowest. During front side turns, the right ankle angle became smaller than the left ankle angle so that the toe edge moved deeper into the snow. Muscle activity during front side turns, the right vastus intermedius muscle, the right biceps femoris muscle, the right gastrocnemius muscle, and the right anterior tibial muscle were shown to be major activated muscles. During backside turns, the right vastus lateralis muscle, the right vastus intermedius muscle, the left biceps femoris muscle, and the right anterior tibial muscle (12.64%) were observed as major activated muscles. Plantar pressure analysis during front side turns, the largest vertical force and plantar pressure acted on the left front food and the right hind foot. During backside turns, the largest vertical force and plantar pressure acted on the left hind foot and the right hind foot. In further studies, the comparison of positions in successive turns is recommended.

**How I think this article represents biomechanics being applied:**
Biomechanics is the study of mechanics as it relates to living organisms. Mechanics is the study of movements and the forces that caused them. Since this research paper studied the forces produced during snowboarding and their resultant movements, this is an application of biomechanics to the field of snowboarding.
