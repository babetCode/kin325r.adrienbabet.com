## 1.
- **Torque**: A measure of the rotational force applied to an object, calculated as the product of force and the perpendicular distance from the pivot point $(\tau = F Ã— r).$  
- **Line of Force Application**: The straight line along which a force is applied to an object.  
- **Moment Arm**: The length of the line that is perpendicular to the axis of rotation and connects the axis of rotation to the line of force application.
- **Force Couple**: A pair of equal and opposite forces between two objects (A acting on B, and B acting on A), as described by Newton's Third Law.  
- **Torque Equilibrium**: A state where the sum of all torques acting on an object is zero, resulting in no rotational acceleration.  
- **Net Torque**: The vector sum of all torques acting on an object, determining its rotational motion.  
- **Center of Gravity**: The point where the total weight of an object is considered to act, balancing the object in all orientations.
