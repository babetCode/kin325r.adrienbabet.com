## 1.

### A.

Taking the average velocity between times $0.033$s and $0.066$s, we have
$$\frac{1.377\text{ units} - 1.221\text{ units}}{0.066\text{ s} - 0.033\text{ s}} = 4.875\text{ units/s}.$$
Assuming these vertical measurements were in meters, the jumper's velocity is $\boxed{4.875\text{ m/s}}.$

### B. 

With a given vertical velocity $v$, a projectile will take $v/g$ seconds to reach its maximum height, during which it will have an average velocity of $v/2$. Therefore, the projectile will rise a distance of
$$\frac vg \cdot \frac v2 = \frac{v^2}{2g}.$$
Plugging in $v = 4.875\text{ m/s}$ and $g = 9.81 \text{ m/s}^2$ gives
$$\frac{(4.875\text{ m/s})^2}{2(9.81 \text{ m/s}^2)} \approx \boxed{1.21\text{ m}}.$$

### C.

The jumper takes off with vertical position of $1.299$ (let's assume this is in meters), so the apex height will be $$1.299\text{ m} + 1.21\text{ m} \approx 2.51\text{ m}.$$
This is higher than the $2.27\text{ m}$ required to clear a $2.24\text{ m}$ bar by $3\text{ cm}$, so **they are high enough to possibly clear the bar.**

## 2.

Taking the average AP velocity between times $3.015$ and $3.025$, we get
$$\frac{0.86112 - 0.840685}{3.025 - 3.015} = 2.0435.$$
Similarly in the vertical dir
Assuming the given data was in meters and seconds, this
