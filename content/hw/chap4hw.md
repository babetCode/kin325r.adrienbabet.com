### A.

Given a set of $k$ point masses
$$\left\\{ \begin{pmatrix}x_1 \\\ y_1 \\\ m_1 \end{pmatrix},\ \begin{pmatrix}x_2 \\\ y_2 \\\ m_2 \end{pmatrix},\ ...,\ \begin{pmatrix}x_k \\\ y_k \\\ m_k \end{pmatrix} \right\\}$$
where each mass is located at it's respective coordinates $(x,y)$ with mass $m$, their total center of mass can be calculated using:
$$\left(\frac{\sum_{n=1}^k(x_n\cdot m_n)}{\sum_{n=1}^k(m_n)}, \frac{\sum_{n=1}^k(y_n\cdot m_n)}{\sum_{n=1}^k(m_n)}\right).$$
As we can see, these formulas for the $x$ and $y$ coordinates have the same form, so we can use this same form for any number of dimensions. In other words, the total center of mass is the weighted average of the point masses, with each point contributing proportionally to its mass.

### B.

To apply this to a 1 dimensional example with a set of three point masses
$$\left\\{ \begin{pmatrix}x_1 \\\ m_1 \end{pmatrix},\ \begin{pmatrix}x_2 \\\ m_2 \end{pmatrix},\ \begin{pmatrix}x_3 \\\ m_3 \end{pmatrix} \right\\},$$
we calculate
$$\frac{\sum_{n=1}^3(x_n\cdot m_n)}{\sum_{n=1}^3(m_n)},$$
which expands to
$$\frac{x_1\cdot m_1 + x_2\cdot m_2 + x_3\cdot m_3}{m_1 + m_2 + m_3}.$$

The location of the whole body center of mass plays a crucial role in various sporting scenarios because it directly influences balance, stability, and the efficiency of movement. For a gymnast performing giant circles around a high bar, the center of mass needs to be positioned close to the bar during the rotation to maintain a tight, controlled circle— if it shifted too far outward, the gymnast would lose momentum or even slip off due to the increased torque and instability. In the case of a sprinter starting out of the blocks, a forward-leaning center of mass allows for a powerful initial push against the blocks, propelling them forward with maximum force; if it were higher or more centered, the sprinter would lose that explosive forward drive and start more upright, slowing their acceleration. For a high jumper going over the bar, the center of mass ideally passes just under the bar while their arched body clears it— if it were higher, they’d need to jump even higher to avoid knocking the bar, making the feat more difficult. Lastly, a linebacker in a low defensive stance relies on a low center of mass to stay balanced and resist being pushed back by opponents; if it were higher, they’d be more easily toppled or driven backward, reducing their effectiveness in holding ground. In each case, the center of mass dictates how forces are managed, shaping the athlete’s performance and success.
