**Have an anthropometric table** & print most of the lecture slides

- Given a force in a tissue and its stiffness, calculate strain.

Print linear kinetics slide deck 

- understand cross product in calculating moments

Come up with a step by step way to solve inverse kinetics & kinematics

**Cross-Product**
$$ \begin{bmatrix}  \end{bmatrix} $$
