This website was created as a learning tool to enhance my understanding of the course material.

**Why I Built This**  
This project is more than just a collection of notes. It's an opportunity for me to:
- Deepen my understanding: By actively engaging with the course content through website creation, I aim to solidify my knowledge of biomechanics principles.
- Practice explaining the material: Translating complex concepts into clear and concise website content will help me refine my understanding and ability to explain these principles to others.
- Mentally organize the material: Structuring and presenting the course information in a logical and organized manner on this website will help me develop a deeper understanding of the relationships between different concepts.

**What You'll Find Here**  
Expect to find a curated collection of resources, including:
- Lecture Notes & Summaries: My own interpretations and summaries of key concepts.
- Interactive Elements: Quizzes, diagrams, and other interactive features to test and reinforce my learning.
- External Resources: Links to relevant articles, videos, and online tools.
- Personal Reflections: My own insights and observations on the course material.

**Disclaimer**  
This website is an independent project and does not represent the official course website. I hope this website proves to be a valuable resource for my own learning journey and perhaps even provides some helpful insights for fellow classmates.
